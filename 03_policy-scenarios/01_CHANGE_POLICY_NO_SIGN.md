# Change a Policy without Signature

## Goal:
- User can not update a policy deployed in an ACM Hub/Managed Clusters without a proper signature  attached.

## Prerequisite: 
- Policy collection is already clone locally in signing host (already done in [prerequisite-step](../prerequisite-setup/GIT_CLONE_POLICY_COLLECTION.md))
- Integrity Shield protection is enabled (already done in [install-scenarios-step](../01_install-scenarios/02_ENABLE_ISHIELD.md))
 
## Action Steps:

Complete the following three steps:

### 1. Go to the directory of your cloned policy collection Git repository in the signing host

   [Command]
   ```
   cd <SIGING HOST DIR>/policy-collection
   ```
   
   
### 2. Edit the policy file `community/SC-System-and-Communications-Protection/policy-ocp4-certs.yaml`
   
   In line 52, change `minimumDuration` from `400h` to `500h`

   [Result]
   ```
   cat community/SC-System-and-Communications-Protection/policy-ocp4-certs.yaml| grep minimumDuration | head -n 1
   500h
   ```
   
### 3. Commit your changes in policy-ocp4-certs.yaml to your cloned policy-collection git repository.

   [Command]
   ```
   git add community/SC-System-and-Communications-Protection/policy-ocp4-certs.yaml
   git commit -m 'policy-ocp4-certs.yaml with out signature'
   git push origin master
   ```
   
 
   
## Expected Result:

continue to check the expected results after a minute (Above changes in Git repository will be synced by ACM Hub Cluster to update the changes in policy.)
